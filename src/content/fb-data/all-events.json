They speak their own made-up language, play by their own rules, and have created an insular world in which boundaries blur between truth and make-believe. But encroaching adulthood calls for an end to their idyll. On their 17th birthdays, in a kind of last dance, they feverishly drink, fantasize, and try to hold onto the childhood that’s slipping through their fingers. An intense and surrealistic play about the fantastical shared worlds within friendships, and the exhilaration and terror of growing up.\r\n\r\nThis site-specific production reimagines Enda Walsh’s seminal play as a rock concert, complete with opening bands and an onstage drummer accompanying the entire performance.","start_time":"2018-03-22T19:30:00-0500","cover":{"offset_x":50,"offset_y":32,"source":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/q88/p720x720/28516603_1165643716872230_537476222345609445_o.jpg?_nc_cat=105&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&oh=f953062b94bb3e4e78da333b21891fd5&oe=5CD88558","id":"1165643716872230"}},{"id":"169375973711043","name":"Let's Talk: Exploring Masculinity","description":"Join us for our monthly discussion and support group. \n\nThe purpose of this meet up is to share stories and reflect on issues of masculinity and gender. \n\nYou're welcome here.
